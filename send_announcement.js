The Obyte Foundation will not decide everything for you, please take part in Obyte governance and either support Fabien by editing the witness list in your wallet as indicated in the article or air your concerns on Obyte Discord, Reddit, or Telegram. Donâ€™t stay indifferent, the faster we decentralize, the more likely we will be able to attract well known real world brands to the project!
